## Why this exists

From **19 June 2026**, any online store selling to consumers in the EU/EEA must let them **withdraw from a contract just as easily as they concluded it**: a prominently displayed, legible **"withdrawal button"**, a two-step confirmation, and an **acknowledgement of receipt on a durable medium** recording the exact date and time. Non-compliance in Italy can mean **AGCM fines up to €10,000,000 or 4% of turnover**, void clauses, and *ex officio* action.

This plugin makes a WooCommerce, FluentCart or Easy Digital Downloads store compliant **out of the box**.

## What it does

- ✅ **Statutory withdrawal button** in the customer's order area, with the exact legal wording per language (IT `recedere dal contratto qui`, EN `withdraw from contract here`, DE `Vertrag widerrufen`, FR `renoncer au contrat ici`, ES `desistir del contrato aquí`).
- ✅ **Two-step flow** (statement → `conferma recesso`) — no dark patterns, no mandatory reason, as easy as buying.
- ✅ **Durable-medium acknowledgement**: immediate email + attached **PDF** + a permanent verifiable link, reproducing the statement content and the precise submission timestamp.
- ✅ **Tamper-evident immutable log** (append-only, hash-chained, IP + contract data + timestamps) anchored to **OpenTimestamps** (free, Bitcoin-backed *data certa*), with a pluggable RFC 3161 / eIDAS provider.
- ✅ **WooCommerce (HPOS + legacy), FluentCart and Easy Digital Downloads (3.0+)** via a common adapter.
- ✅ **Multilingual** (IT/EN/FR/ES/DE, extensible) and **jurisdiction-aware** (DE §356a, FR D.221-5, ES direct-effect; Switzerland handled as voluntary; applicability follows the **consumer's country** per Rome I Art. 6).
- ✅ **Compliance documents**: generates the **Annex I-B model withdrawal form** (multilingual) and ready clauses for Privacy Policy / Terms / pre-contractual info.
- ✅ **Plays nicely** with **Complianz** and **TranslatePress**; excluded from page cache where needed; **shortcodes + blocks + hooks + template overrides** for customisation.

## Status

🚧 **In active development.** This repository currently contains the full design + legal analysis (see [`docs/`](docs/)) and the **F0 foundation** (bootstrap, schema, debug stack, REST diagnostics). The withdrawal flow, durable medium, log chain and compliance documents are landing phase by phase — see the [roadmap](docs/plans/wwu-wb-roadmap-PLAN.md).

## Known issues & limitations

We document limitations openly. None of these block the legal compliance core — the withdrawal button, two-step flow, durable-medium acknowledgement, verifiable link and immutable log all work across all three platforms (WooCommerce, FluentCart, Easy Digital Downloads).

- **FluentCart email merge-tag `{{wwu.recesso_url}}` (since `1.0.0-alpha.37` — needs a live test).** You can drop the per-order withdrawal link into FluentCart's *own* transactional emails (e.g. the order receipt) via the `{{wwu.recesso_url}}` tag. The FluentCart team confirmed (2026-06-15) the value-resolver hook (`fluent_cart/smartcode_fallback`) and its `$data` context, so the tag is now registered in the FluentCart email-editor picker and resolved at send time — with the team's required `$data['order']` safety check (it renders empty in footers / contexts without an order). **Heads-up:** FluentCart told us they are shipping a **native EU withdrawal feature soon**, which may overlap this; our integration stays fail-safe and the consumer can always reach the withdrawal from the FluentCart **"Right of withdrawal"** portal page and the standalone public page regardless. (See [`docs/analysis/wwu-wb-fluentcart-hooks-ANALYSIS.md`](docs/analysis/wwu-wb-fluentcart-hooks-ANALYSIS.md) §"Third verification round".)
- **FluentCart customer portal is a Vue SPA.** In-portal styling of the order chooser is best-effort (the portal's shortcode tag isn't documented for asset detection); the chooser rows and the per-order button link to the standalone page where the plugin's CSS/JS always load, so the flow works regardless.
- **PDF receipt needs Dompdf.** If you install from source without building the bundled `vendor/` (`composer install`), PDF generation is skipped and the durable medium is **email-only** — which still satisfies the obligation (the email carries the full textual acknowledgement). Build the vendor dir to enable the attached PDF.
- **Digital products show the button by default.** Since `1.0.0-alpha.24` the Art. 59 digital auto-exclusion defaults **off** — the right of withdrawal is the default and the button shows on digital products too. The digital-content exemption (Art. 59 lett. o) is only legally valid when prior express consent + acknowledgement were captured. The **Exemptions** feature ([SPEC](docs/specs/wwu-wb-withdrawal-exemptions-SPEC.md)) lets merchants do this correctly: **Settings → Exemptions** tags products/categories by specific statutory reason, and since `1.0.0-alpha.28` the **WooCommerce checkout captures the required consent + acknowledgement** for the conditional reasons (digital-immediate / service-performed) — only then is the button hidden for those items (filterable wording via `wwu_wb_consent_text`). Consent capture is **live on every checkout**: WooCommerce **classic** (alpha.28) and **block** Checkout (alpha.32, via the official Additional Checkout Fields API, WC 9.9+), **FluentCart** (alpha.30; since alpha.34 on the `before_payment_methods` hook so it also covers the modal/block checkout, and **category-aware**) and **Easy Digital Downloads** (alpha.33, EDD 3.0+, category-aware — [SPEC](docs/specs/wwu-wb-edd-integration-SPEC.md)). All three platforms now match exemptions by **both product and category**. Any path where capture isn't available keeps the button (fail-safe).
