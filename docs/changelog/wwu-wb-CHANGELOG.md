# Changelog — WWU Withdrawal Button

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); the project uses Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Consumer guidance + timestamp provider reference (1.0.0-alpha.17, 2026-06-14)
- **Consumer "how withdrawal works" guidance** (`partials/consumer-guidance.php`)
  shown wherever a consumer can start a withdrawal — the two-step form and the My
  Account / public chooser: a short reassuring intro + a collapsible plain-language
  explanation (14-day period, no reason needed, the two-step confirm, immediate
  email acknowledgement, refund within 14 days same method, returning goods, Art.
  59 exceptions, contact us). Improves UX and transparency/compliance. i18n.
- **Timestamp providers reference in Settings**: a collapsible list of the main
  providers with one-line blurbs and links to their official sites (OpenTimestamps,
  Sectigo free/qualified, DigiCert, and per-country QTSPs Aruba/InfoCert, D-Trust,
  Universign, FNMT, SwissSign) so the merchant can pick and paste the right
  endpoint.
- Audit follow-up: the `wwu_wb_timestamp` default seed now uses the nested
  `rfc3161 => { endpoint, user, pass }` shape the code reads (was a dead
  `rfc3161_url` key). RFC 3161 audit verdict was ship (2 low security notes
  accepted: admin-config endpoint as trust boundary; nonce fallback entropy).

### RFC 3161 / eIDAS timestamp provider (1.0.0-alpha.16, 2026-06-14)
- **New `Rfc3161Provider`** for the pluggable timestamp layer: sends the log
  row's SHA-256 to an RFC 3161 Time-Stamp Authority and stores the signed token.
  Unlike OpenTimestamps (Bitcoin, asynchronous), an RFC 3161 token is final
  immediately, so the stamp is confirmed at creation (the upgrade cron skips it).
  The ASN.1 request/response is hand-rolled (no `openssl ts` exec dependency, no
  extra library). Verified end-to-end against Sectigo's free eIDAS-qualified TSA
  (PKIStatus granted).
- **Settings**: "Trusted timestamp" now offers OpenTimestamps / RFC 3161 / None,
  with an endpoint field (prefilled with the free, no-account eIDAS-qualified
  `timestamp.sectigo.com/qualified`) and optional Basic-auth credentials for paid
  national QTSPs (Aruba, InfoCert, D-Trust, Universign, FNMT, SwissSign…). The
  password uses the "leave blank to keep" pattern and is never re-emitted.
- `TimestampService` routes `provider=rfc3161` to the new provider and confirms
  synchronous proofs immediately. Smoke suite `rfc3161` (request DER shape, SHA-256
  OID, digest embedding, PKIStatus parsing, empty-endpoint/bad-hex guards).
- Background: any RFC 3161 TSA works by config; `wwu_wb_timestamp_provider` filter
  still lets integrators inject custom providers. See
  `docs/analysis/wwu-wb-timestamp-providers-ANALYSIS.md`.

### Refund evidence + procedure guide (1.0.0-alpha.15, 2026-06-14)
- **Reimbursement is now recorded in the evidence log.** `WooRefundRecorder`
  hooks `woocommerce_order_refunded` and appends a `refund_issued` event (amount,
  currency, refund id, timestamp, acting user) for orders that have a withdrawal
  request — proof that the trader met the 14-day reimbursement duty. The Requests
  page Status column shows "Refunded <amount>" (read live from WooCommerce).
- **"What to do after receiving a request" guide** on the Requests page: a
  collapsible, plain-language step-by-step (scope check → returns/withholding →
  reimburse within 14 days, same payment method → mark processed), accurate to
  Art. 56–57 with an Art. 59 caveat. i18n.
- Process-workflow review fixes: honest `mark_failed` feedback when the order
  can't be loaded; a 20s debounce on "Resend email" to avoid double-sending to
  the consumer.

### Merchant process workflow + list CSS (1.0.0-alpha.14, 2026-06-14)
- **Process workflow on the admin Requests page.** A withdrawal is the consumer's
  unilateral right (no "approve" step) — so the actions are operational: a
  **Status** column (Open / Processed), **Mark processed** (records the state on
  the order + logs `request_processed` to the immutable log), **Resend email**
  (re-dispatches the acknowledgement — fulfils the failure notice's "resend from
  the Requests page" promise; reconstructs the statement from the confirmed log
  row), and **Refund order** (deep-links to the WooCommerce order screen where the
  refund is issued within the 14-day deadline). A plain-language banner explains
  the legal nature (reimburse within 14 days, same payment method).
  `ConfirmationDispatcher::dispatch()` now returns the send result and exposes a
  `resend( uid )` method.
- **Front-end list CSS.** Removed the duplicate "Right of withdrawal" heading
  (the My Account endpoint / page already render it) and gave the orders chooser
  a self-contained `.wwu-wb-orders` style (replacing WooCommerce's
  `shop_table_responsive`, which clashed with the theme and overlapped the
  button/status): padded cells, row borders, a compact inline status pill, a
  small button variant, and a theme-independent mobile stack.

### Frontend usability: order list, verify page, email preview, block (1.0.0-alpha.13, 2026-06-14)
- **Eligible-orders list**: the My Account "Right of withdrawal" tab rendered an
  empty placeholder, and the public `[wwu_wb_form]` page with no order in context
  only said "Order not found" — so a customer never saw an order to act on. A
  shared `EligibleOrders` builder now lists the customer's recent WooCommerce
  orders (HPOS-safe) that are eligible now or already requested; both surfaces use
  it. Guests are guided to the order-email link.
- **Readable verification page**: `/verify/{uid}` now content-negotiates — a
  browser gets a self-contained "certificate" page (intact/altered, order,
  datetime, within-window, evidence hash), API clients and `?format=json` still
  get JSON.
- **Email preview in Settings**: a "Preview the acknowledgement email" link opens
  the email built from sample data — on WooCommerce through the WC style inliner,
  so it shows the store's email branding exactly as sent.
- **Gutenberg block** `wwu-wb/withdrawal-form` ("Withdrawal — self-service"): a
  dynamic, server-rendered block that wraps the form shortcode (same applicability
  + ownership gates), shipped with no build step (vanilla editor JS +
  ServerSideRender preview). WooCommerce Blocks note: the My Account page is still
  shortcode-rendered in current WooCommerce, so the existing classic hooks remain
  the supported integration and keep working under block themes; the block adds an
  editor placement option.

### WooCommerce email integration (1.0.0-alpha.12, 2026-06-14)
- The consumer **acknowledgement of receipt is now a first-class `WC_Email`**
  (`WooAckEmail`, id `wwu_wb_withdrawal_ack`). It appears under WooCommerce →
  Settings → Emails, inherits the store's email branding (logo, base colour,
  header/footer), is customisable (subject, heading, additional content, email
  type) and template-overridable in the theme at
  `woocommerce/emails/wwu-wb-withdrawal-ack.php` (+ `plain/`).
- **Delivery routing** in `ConfirmationDispatcher`: on WooCommerce it sends the
  branded WC email when the merchant has it enabled; otherwise (FluentCart, WC
  absent, or the email disabled) it falls back to the plain standalone mailer.
  Because the acknowledgement is legally mandatory, the WooCommerce enable/disable
  toggle controls only the *styling/integration* — it never stops the email from
  being sent. The `receipt_failed` log + admin notice still fire if neither path
  delivers.
- Locale stays the consumer's (the dispatcher's `switch_to_locale()` owns it; the
  WC email deliberately does not call `setup_locale()`). The PDF receipt is passed
  through as the email attachment when available.
- Reviewed by parallel security + correctness sub-agents.

### Email diagnostics + onboarding rework (1.0.0-alpha.11, 2026-06-14)
- **Decoupled the PDF from the send**: `ConfirmationDispatcher` now guards the
  optional PDF render/store with `PdfBuilder::is_available()`. A missing Dompdf
  can never affect the acknowledgement email (which is the legal durable medium);
  the PDF is only an extra copy.
- **Email-delivery diagnostics on the dashboard** (the real answer to "why didn't
  I get an email?"): a checklist row detects a known SMTP plugin (FluentSMTP, WP
  Mail SMTP, Post SMTP, Easy WP SMTP, Mailster) or a `phpmailer_init` integration
  and warns when none is present, plus a **"Send test email"** button. The handler
  is capability-gated + nonce-checked + throttled and always sends only to the
  current admin's own address (never request input), so it can't be abused as a
  relay. Reviewed by parallel security + correctness sub-agents (0 findings).
- **Onboarding rework**: the dashboard no longer leads with page-creation unless a
  form page is actually missing; when everything is in place it explains **how the
  plugin works** (the 4-step consumer flow) and where the button appears.
- **Fix (visible bug)**: `Template::render()` had a `$name` parameter colliding
  with template variables of the same key (`extract(EXTR_SKIP)` skipped them), so
  the form's "name" field (and the email) showed the template path instead of the
  consumer's name. Rendering now happens in an isolated scope with reserved
  variable names — fixes the form and all email/PDF templates.
- **Onboarding Dashboard** (`DashboardPage`): replaces the placeholder. A setup
  checklist (enabled / platform / form page / PDF) with one-click fixes, a plain
  explanation of **where the button appears**, and the reasons it might be hidden
  on an order (out-of-scope country, non-contract status, Art.59/B2B, disabled) —
  written for non-technical merchants.
- **Settings completed**: a "Where the button applies" section (applicability
  mode always / EU-EEA / custom + custom country list + B2B toggle) so merchants
  can choose to show it everywhere; a "Receipt & evidence" section (attach-PDF,
  notification email, retention years, OpenTimestamps/none provider, account-tab
  slug with rewrite flush). The PDF row warns when the library is missing and how
  to fix it without the command line.

### Custom CSS + styling reference (1.0.0-alpha.9, 2026-06-13)
- Frontend CSS refactored to expose **CSS custom properties** (`--wwu-wb-*`) on
  every element (accent, radius, button/field/notice colors, spacing) for
  one-line theming, while keeping all `.wwu-wb-*` classes for full control.
- **Settings → Appearance — Custom CSS**: a textarea where the merchant pastes
  CSS (loaded inline after the plugin styles, so it overrides), plus a collapsible
  **reference listing every CSS variable (with default + purpose) and every class
  (with what it targets)** and ready examples. Sanitised via `Sanitizer::css()`
  (strips tags/`</style>` break-out, neutralises `expression()`/`javascript:`/
  `behavior:`/`@import`; 50 KB cap). Applied on the frontend surfaces and the
  no-JS fallback pages. Compliance note in the UI: must not hide/shrink/low-contrast
  the statutory button.

### Audit hardening — core F0–F6 (1.0.0-alpha.7, 2026-06-13)
Parallel security + performance + compliance audit (sub-agents). Security: **0
findings**. Closed all critical/high compliance gaps + all high/medium perf
findings. See `docs/audits/wwu-wb-core-2026-06-13-AUDIT.md`.
- **Compliance (critical)**: order-status eligibility gate centralised in
  `ApplicabilityResolver` (no button on failed/cancelled/refunded/unpaid orders);
  guest path fixed — `Install::ensure_form_page()` auto-creates the public
  `[wwu_wb_form]` page, `OrderEmailLink` adds the statutory link (with order key)
  to WooCommerce customer emails, admin warning when no form page is set.
- **Compliance (high)**: `NoScriptFlow` server-rendered no-JavaScript fallback
  (admin-post two-step); JS is now progressive enhancement.
- **Compliance (medium/low)**: mail-failure now logged (`receipt_failed`) + admin
  notice (`wwu_wb_mail_failed`); late flag shown in the admin email.
- **Performance**: DB-1 chain-corruption guard (abort append if `GET_LOCK` fails);
  public `/verify` does O(1) per-row integrity (full-chain scan cached, admin
  only); `Core\Settings` per-request option cache across hot resolvers;
  `batch_meta()` (1 save instead of 7 in confirm); `script_loader_tag` filter
  scoped to enqueue; `labels/exclusions/timestamp` options set autoload=no.
- Lint clean (php -l 67 files, node --check).

### F4 + compat (1.0.0-alpha.5/.6, 2026-06-13)
OpenTimestamps anchoring + Complianz/cache compatibility + FluentCart adapter
(see commits).

### F5/F7/F8 — Legal documents, shortcodes, admin dashboard (1.0.0-alpha.4, 2026-06-13)
- **F5 legal documents**: `ModelForm` (Annex I-B model withdrawal form, official
  wording IT/EN/DE/FR/ES) + `ClauseLibrary` (pre-contractual / terms / privacy
  clauses, IT+EN full, others EN-fallback with review note).
- **F7 shortcodes**: `[wwu_wb_button]`, `[wwu_wb_form]`, `[wwu_wb_status]`,
  `[wwu_wb_model_form]`, `[wwu_wb_info]` — order-scoped ones gated by ownership/
  key/token, render nothing on failure.
- **F8 admin**: Requests dashboard (confirmed requests from the immutable log,
  late flag, evidence link, chain-integrity badge) + Compliance page (go-live
  countdown, document checklist + copyable clauses + model-form shortcode,
  Complianz/TranslatePress/cache environment notes). New menu: Dashboard /
  Requests / Compliance / Settings / Debug Inspector.
- Lint clean.

### F3 — Durable medium (1.0.0-alpha.3, 2026-06-13)
- `ConfirmationDispatcher` listens on `wwu_wb_withdrawal_confirmed` and sends the
  acknowledgement of receipt synchronously (Art. 11a(4) "without undue delay"),
  reproducing the statement content + exact submission date/time.
- `PdfBuilder` (Dompdf, LGPL-2.1; `isRemoteEnabled=false`, DejaVu Sans, A4) with
  graceful degradation to email-only when the vendor dir is absent. Dompdf v3.1.5
  added via Composer (`composer.lock` committed; `vendor/` gitignored).
- `ReceiptStore` (protected uploads dir, .htaccess deny + uid-named files),
  `VerifiableLink` (stable HMAC token), `ReceiptBuilder` (trader/Annex-I-B-style
  data), `Mailer` (HTML + attachment). Locale-switched to the consumer's language.
- REST `/receipt/{uid}` (token-gated PDF stream) + `/verify/{uid}` (hash +
  submission time + chain-integrity status), rate-limited, enumeration-safe.
- Email/PDF templates (consumer, admin, PDF). Smoke suite `durable_medium`.
- Lint clean.

### F1 — WooCommerce withdrawal flow (1.0.0-alpha.2, 2026-06-13)
- Platform adapter layer: `OrderDataSource` interface + `NormalizedOrder` VO +
  HPOS-safe `WooCommerceAdapter` + `PlatformRegistry`; custom order status
  `wc-wb-requested` (3 status hooks + dual bulk-action hooks).
- Domain: `LabelResolver` (statutory IT/EN/DE/FR/ES labels, override warning,
  DE "no hier" guard), `WindowCalculator` (informational 14-day window, never
  hides the button), `ArticleFiftyNineEvaluator` (per-item exclusions, mixed
  cart), `ApplicabilityResolver` (consumer-country / Rome I, CH voluntary, B2B
  VAT, modes), `WithdrawalRequest` VO, `WithdrawalService` (two-step orchestration).
- Immutable log: `LogChain` (canonical, order-independent hash) + append-only
  `LogRepository` (GET_LOCK-serialised global hash chain + chain verifier).
- Frontend: `WooMyAccount` (orders-list action + order-detail injection +
  account endpoint tab), two-step form template + vanilla JS controller,
  `Assets` (conditional enqueue + Complianz marker), `GuestAccess` (HMAC token +
  rate limit), `Template` loader (theme override + realpath confinement).
- REST: `/withdrawal/lookup`, `/withdrawal/statement`, `/withdrawal/confirm`
  (per-request ownership/key/token access; enumeration-safe errors).
- Smoke suites added: `labels`, `applicability`, `window`, `log`.
- Lint: php -l + node --check clean.

### Planning (2026-06-13)
- Interview completed (4 rounds) and two reconnaissance workflows run (12 + 7 sub-agents) with
  adversarial legal verification against EUR-Lex primary sources.
- **SPEC** written: `docs/specs/wwu-wb-eu-withdrawal-button-SPEC.md` (12 canonical sections).
- **Legal reference** (verbatim Art. 11a EN+IT, Recital 37, Art. 54-bis, Annex I-B, per-country
  labels, Rome I applicability, GDPR): `docs/legal/wwu-wb-legal-reference.md`.
- **Compliance matrix** (clause → feature → test): `docs/legal/wwu-wb-compliance-matrix.md`.
- **Implementation roadmap** (phases F0–F9 + audits + queued video): `docs/plans/wwu-wb-roadmap-PLAN.md`.
- **MASTER** index created; `.gitignore` + `_internal/` (gitignored) scaffolded.
- Key decisions locked: dual platform (WooCommerce + FluentCart) Day 1; PDF = Dompdf (LGPL-2.1,
  GPLv3-compatible); timestamping = OpenTimestamps + pluggable RFC 3161/eIDAS; immutable
  hash-chained append-only log; applicability by consumer country (Rome I); statutory per-country
  labels (DE §356a "Vertrag widerrufen" no-"hier", FR D.221-5, ES direct-effect); no MU-plugin.

> Implementation (Phase F0 onward) has not started yet. The first released version will be `1.0.0`.
