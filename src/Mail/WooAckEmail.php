<?php
/**
 * WooCommerce-integrated acknowledgement-of-receipt email.
 *
 * Registers the durable-medium acknowledgement (Art. 11a(4)) as a first-class
 * WC_Email so it appears under WooCommerce → Settings → Emails, inherits the
 * store's email branding (logo, base colour, header/footer) and is customisable
 * (subject, heading, additional content, email type) and template-overridable in
 * the theme (woocommerce/emails/wwu-wb-withdrawal-ack.php).
 *
 * COMPLIANCE NOTE — the acknowledgement is legally MANDATORY. The WooCommerce
 * enable/disable toggle here only controls whether this *branded* version is used:
 * when it is disabled, ConfirmationDispatcher falls back to the plain built-in
 * template so the legally-required email is still delivered. Disabling never
 * stops the acknowledgement from being sent.
 *
 * LOCALE — ConfirmationDispatcher already switches to the consumer's locale around
 * the whole dispatch, so this class deliberately does NOT call setup_locale() /
 * restore_locale() (which would switch to the site locale instead).
 *
 * This class extends \WC_Email, which only exists once WooCommerce is loaded. It
 * is therefore only ever autoloaded from inside the woocommerce_email_classes
 * filter callback (which fires after WooCommerce init) — never at plugin boot.
 *
 * @package WWU\WithdrawalButton
