EU statutory withdrawal button (Art. 11a) for WooCommerce, FluentCart & EDD: two-step flow, durable-medium receipt, tamper-evident log.

== Description ==

Product page & documentation: https://webwakeup.it/wwu-withdrawal-button/

From 19 June 2026, EU law (Directive (EU) 2023/2673, new Art. 11a of the Consumer Rights Directive; Italy: Art. 54-bis Codice del Consumo) requires online stores to provide a **withdrawal function** that lets consumers withdraw from a distance contract as easily as they concluded it. WWU Withdrawal Button adds that function — and everything around it you need to run it and to prove you did it right — to WooCommerce, FluentCart and Easy Digital Downloads.

= How it works (in plain terms) =

1. An eligible customer opens their order and clicks the statutory **"Withdraw from contract here"** button — in their account, from a link in the order e-mail, or on a public page (no account needed: they look the order up with its number + e-mail).
2. A simple **two-step form** appears: they review what they are withdrawing from (optionally ticking only some items — partial withdrawal is allowed), then confirm. No reason required, no hoops.
3. The instant they confirm, the customer receives an **acknowledgement of receipt on a durable medium** — an e-mail, a PDF copy and a permanent verifiable link — showing exactly what was withdrawn and the precise date and time. The order is flagged "withdrawal requested".
4. Every step is written to a **tamper-evident, append-only log** (hash-chained and timestamped) so you can prove what happened and when. You then handle the refund as usual — the plugin records that too.

That is the whole customer experience. Everything below exists to make it correct, easy to run, and defensible.

= For your customers =

* A prominently displayed, legible button with the **exact statutory wording per language** (IT, EN, DE, FR, ES, SV — extensible).
* The button appears where customers actually look: the **account area** (order list, order detail, a dedicated "Right of withdrawal" tab), a **link inside order e-mails**, a **public self-service page** with guest lookup, and anywhere via **shortcodes** or the **Gutenberg block**.
* A short, reassuring **step-by-step guide** during the flow (timing, refund, returns); the wording and the withdrawal window (≥14 days — you may grant more) are editable.
* When an order is genuinely exempt, a clear **"why is the button not here" note** explains the specific legal exception, instead of leaving the customer confused.
* A human-readable **verification certificate** for the receipt (integrity, order, date, hash) — not raw code.

= For you (the merchant) =

* An onboarding **Dashboard** with a setup checklist (one-click fixes), a plain "how it works" walkthrough, and a "where the button appears / why it might not" explainer.
* A one-click **e-mail delivery test** that detects your SMTP plugin and proves the receipt actually reaches the inbox — the #1 cause of "nothing happened".
* A **Requests dashboard** to manage every withdrawal: status (open / processed / refunded), a chain-integrity badge, and one-click **mark processed**, **resend receipt** and **open the order to refund** (the refund is logged as proof you met the 14 days). Subscription and partial-withdrawal requests are flagged.
* A **Compliance page**: a go-live countdown, the statutory labels in use, the document checklist with ready-to-paste clauses, and environment warnings (Complianz / cache / multilingual) to fix.
* Receipts are **real WooCommerce e-mails** (your logo, colours, header) with a preview, and everything is styleable via a **Custom CSS** field.

= Smart legal handling (so you don't have to think about it) =

* **Subscriptions** — the law gives one 14-day right per contract, so the button shows on the **initial order only** and is hidden on renewals (WooCommerce Subscriptions, FluentCart, EDD Recurring). Fail-safe, with opt-in overrides.
* **Partial withdrawal** — customers can withdraw from only some items of an order.
* **Art. 59 exemptions** — tag products or categories by the specific statutory reason (events on a fixed date, digital content with immediate access, a service fully performed…). For the conditional reasons the plugin captures the customer's **express consent at checkout** (WooCommerce classic + block, FluentCart, EDD), stores it as evidence, sends the required durable-medium confirmation, and only then hides the button. **Physical products always keep the right** — never hidden by mistake.
* **Applicability by country** — EU/EEA consumers only (default) or always; B2B (VAT) orders can be treated as out of scope.

= Evidence, timestamps & integrity =

* The immutable log is **append-only and hash-chained** (HMAC-keyed with your site secret), so tampering is detectable.
* Free, independently-verifiable **OpenTimestamps** (Bitcoin) anchoring by default; or a **qualified eIDAS RFC 3161** timestamp (a free Sectigo endpoint, or your national authority — Aruba, InfoCert, D-Trust, Universign, FNMT, SwissSign) for stronger "data certa". Failed stamps retry automatically and any not-yet-anchored records are surfaced in the admin.

= Privacy & GDPR =

* The log commits to an **anonymised IP**; the full IP lives separately and is **erased after a configurable retention** (10 years by default).
* A **Consent records** screen lists and exports the exemption consents (CSV). Two ready-to-paste privacy clauses are generated (withdrawal log + exemption-consent), on a legitimate-interest basis. The uninstaller keeps the evidence log by default (legal hold) unless you opt to erase it.

= Documents & compliance =

* Generates the **Annex I-B model withdrawal form** and ready clauses for **pre-contractual information, Terms & Conditions and Privacy** — and reminds you, clearly, that installing the button is **not enough**: your Terms and pre-contractual withdrawal article must be updated to describe the new button modality (the plugin gives you the exact text to paste).

= Integrations & automation =

* A **read-only REST API** (authenticated with a standard Application Password) to list requests and check an order's withdrawal status, plus an optional **signed webhook** (HMAC-SHA256) fired the moment a withdrawal is confirmed — for Zapier, Make, n8n, a CRM or a helpdesk. Privacy-first: the consumer's IP is never exposed. **33 documented hooks/filters** for developers.
* Plays nicely with **Complianz**, **TranslatePress** and page-cache plugins (WP Rocket / LiteSpeed / W3TC).

= Platforms & licence =

* **WooCommerce (HPOS + legacy), FluentCart and Easy Digital Downloads (3.0+)** through a common adapter — one plugin for all three. On FluentCart it can step aside automatically if FluentCart ships its own native withdrawal add-on, so customers never see two buttons.
* **Free and open source** (GPLv3) — no upsell, no tracking, no remote scripts or fonts loaded on your site. Passed a full multi-dimension security audit (0 critical / 0 high).

This plugin is a technical aid to compliance and is **not legal advice**. Have your own counsel review your store's documents.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to `/wp-content/plugins/` and activate it.
2. Activate WooCommerce and/or FluentCart.
3. Go to **Withdrawal Button → Settings**, enable the function, and choose your applicability mode (EU/EEA only is the default).
4. Publish the generated Annex I-B model form and update your Privacy / Terms / pre-contractual information from the Compliance page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who must comply? =
Any trader concluding distance B2C contracts via an online interface with EU/EEA consumers, regardless of the trader's own country (Rome I Art. 6). Switzerland-resident consumers are out of scope (voluntary mode).

= Does it replace the model withdrawal form? =
No. The button is **additional** to the Annex I-B model form, which remains mandatory in pre-contractual information. The plugin generates both.

= Do digital products lose the right of withdrawal automatically? =
No. The right of withdrawal applies by default, **including** to digital products. It is removed only for the two conditional Art. 59 exemptions (digital content with immediate access; a service fully performed) and only when the consumer gives prior express consent + acknowledgement at checkout. The plugin captures that on the WooCommerce checkout (a required tick-box), stores it as evidence, and only then hides the button — otherwise the button stays (fail-safe). **Physical products never need consent.** For the digital exemption the plugin also e-mails the consumer a durable-medium confirmation, as the law requires.

= Do I have to keep a register of these consents? =
The law does not name a "register", but the burden of proof is on you (Art. 6(9) Dir. 2011/83/EU; GDPR accountability Art. 5(2)) — you must be able to prove the consent. The plugin keeps it for you: the agreed wording, a SHA-256 hash, the date/time and (optionally) the IP are stored on the order and anchored in the tamper-evident log; a **Consent records** admin screen lists and exports them. The IP is anonymised automatically after the retention period.

= Is the timestamp legally valid? =
OpenTimestamps provides a free, independently-verifiable Bitcoin-anchored proof. A pluggable RFC 3161 / eIDAS qualified-timestamp provider is available for stronger "data certa".

== External services ==

This plugin connects to the **OpenTimestamps** public calendar servers to obtain a free, trusted timestamp (a "data certa") for the tamper-evident withdrawal log. This is the default timestamp provider; you can switch it to "none" in the settings to disable all external calls.

- **What is sent:** only a SHA-256 hash (a one-way digest) of the immutable-log record, plus a random privacy nonce. No personal data, order content, names, emails or IP addresses are ever sent — only an opaque hash that cannot be reversed.
- **When:** once when a withdrawal is confirmed (to submit the hash) and periodically via WP-Cron (to retrieve the Bitcoin-anchored proof).
- **Where:** the OpenTimestamps public calendars (a.pool.opentimestamps.org, b.pool.opentimestamps.org, a.pool.eternitywall.com, ots.btc.catallaxy.com).
- **Service info / privacy:** https://opentimestamps.org/

**Optional** services, all **off by default** and used only if you turn them on:

- **RFC 3161 / eIDAS timestamp authority** — if you switch the timestamp provider away from OpenTimestamps, the same one-way SHA-256 hash (no personal data) is sent instead to the timestamp-authority URL you configure.
- **Outbound webhook** (Settings → Integrations) — if enabled, the plugin sends a signed POST to the endpoint URL **you** specify whenever a withdrawal is confirmed. The payload carries a verification hash and contract reference, never the consumer's IP address.

No other external services are used. The plugin does not load remote scripts, fonts or trackers on your site.

== Privacy ==

The plugin records withdrawal declarations (name, identified contract, email, IP address, date and time) in an append-only, tamper-evident log on **your own server**, because Art. 54-bis requires this as legal evidence (GDPR Art. 6(1)(c)/(f)). It generates a ready-to-paste privacy clause for your policy. Data is retained for a configurable period (10 years by default), and the uninstaller keeps the evidence log by default (legal hold) unless you opt to erase it.

For the conditional Art. 59 exemptions, the plugin also stores the consumer's checkout consent + acknowledgement (the agreed wording, a hash, the date/time and — unless you turn it off — the IP) as evidence to prove the exemption is valid. The lawful basis is **legitimate interest** (GDPR Art. 6(1)(f); defence of legal claims), **not** GDPR consent. The IP lives only on the order (never in the immutable log) and is automatically anonymised once the retention period lapses. A second ready-to-paste privacy clause is generated for this processing.

== Changelog ==

= 1.2.0 =
* **Reminder to update your legal texts — the button is not a substitute.** Installing the withdrawal button does not change your shop's own documents, and EU law (Art. 6 of the Consumer Rights Directive) requires your Terms & Conditions of sale and your pre-contractual information to describe *how* the consumer withdraws — which now includes the new online "withdrawal button". The plugin now states this prominently on the Dashboard and the Compliance page, opens the two clauses you must paste (pre-contractual information + general terms) by default, and the ready-to-paste "How to withdraw" and pre-contractual clauses now name the button explicitly. This release also **rewrites the plugin description** to explain, in plain steps, **how the withdrawal flow works** and to showcase the **full feature set** (customer help, merchant cockpit, smart legal handling, automations, privacy tooling). No change to the withdrawal flow itself.

= 1.1.1 =
* **wordpress.org Plugin Check polish.** Removes the unused UI-kit `clipboard.js` from the package entirely (its filename collided with a WordPress-core library; it was never loaded — only the accordion, badge and utilities components are), and moves the documentation link out of the short-description block. No functional change.

= 1.1.0 =
* **Evidence-log hardening (security-audit follow-up).** The tamper-evident log is now stronger against a database-level/insider attacker and cleaner under GDPR: each row hash is **HMAC-keyed** with the site secret (so a DB-write attacker without the secret can no longer recompute a forged chain); the hash commits to the **anonymised** IP while the full IP is stored separately and **erased after the retention horizon**; RFC 3161 timestamps now **require HTTPS** and are **bound to the exact submitted digest** (a TSA/MITM cannot return a token for a different hash); failed initial timestamps are **retried automatically**, with any not-yet-anchored records surfaced in the admin. Existing logs keep verifying (each row records its chain version). No change to the withdrawal flow.

= 1.0.1 =
* **wordpress.org readiness + security hardening.** Resolves the Plugin Check items for the directory submission: the unused `clipboard.js` UI-kit asset is no longer shipped, `composer.json` is now included alongside the bundled library, the SSRF smoke-test no longer uses a literal localhost host, and "Tested up to" is current. Plus minor hardening from a full security audit: the OpenTimestamps calls now pass through the same SSRF guard as the webhook / RFC 3161 callers (and never follow redirects), and two admin credential fields gain `wp_unslash()`. No functional change to the withdrawal flow.

= 1.0.0 =
* **First stable release**, for the EU withdrawal-button mandate that applies from **19 June 2026**. Consolidates the full feature set: the statutory two-step withdrawal flow with per-language wording (IT, EN, DE, FR, ES, SV), a durable-medium acknowledgement (email + PDF + verifiable link + OpenTimestamps), a tamper-evident hash-chained log, the Art. 59 exemptions with checkout consent capture and a consumer "why exempt" note, optional partial withdrawal, WooCommerce (HPOS + legacy) / FluentCart / Easy Digital Downloads adapters, the withdrawal link in order e-mails, a read-only REST API + signed webhook for automations, and the Annex I-B model form + ready legal clauses. All six locales fully translated (545/545). No functional change from 1.0.0-alpha.45 — the External services disclosure was clarified and translations finalised for release.

= 1.0.0-alpha.45 =
* **Withdrawal link in your order e-mails — across all platforms.** The withdrawal link is added **automatically** to WooCommerce customer order e-mails and to the Easy Digital Downloads purchase-receipt e-mail (so customers can reach the withdrawal straight from the e-mail, as the law's Recital 37 suggests). FluentCart doesn't allow plugins to add content to its e-mails automatically, so **Settings → FluentCart** now shows a short, optional one-time guide to drop the `{{wwu.recesso_url}}` shortcode into your FluentCart receipt template (copy-ready, 3 steps). Nothing invasive, nothing required — the withdrawal is always reachable from the account/portal and the public page regardless.

= 1.0.0-alpha.44 =
* **Connect your withdrawal requests to other tools (automations).** A new **Settings → Integrations** section adds two optional, developer-friendly ways to plug withdrawal requests into Zapier, Make, n8n, a CRM or a helpdesk. (1) A **read-only REST API** to list requests and check an order's withdrawal status, authenticated with a standard WordPress Application Password. (2) An optional **webhook** that sends a signed notification to your endpoint the moment a withdrawal is confirmed. Privacy-first: the consumer's IP address is never exposed — only a verification hash. There is intentionally no way to *create* a withdrawal via the API (a withdrawal is the consumer's own legal act). Passed a dedicated security audit before release. No change to the withdrawal flow itself.

= 1.0.0-alpha.43 =
* **Consumers now see WHY the withdrawal button is absent on exempt orders.** When an order is exempt from the right of withdrawal under Art. 59 (e.g. digital content with immediate access, or a service fully performed — both with the consumer's consent at checkout), the button is hidden. The plugin now shows a short, accurate note explaining the specific statutory exception and its legal reference, instead of just silence. Shown on the withdrawal form, the WooCommerce/EDD account pages and the FluentCart portal. The text is editable (Settings → Consumer guidance). It only appears on genuinely exempt orders — never on ordinary ones; button visibility is unchanged.

= 1.0.0-alpha.42 =
* **You can now withdraw from only some products of an order.** EU law allows partial withdrawal (it's not all-or-nothing), so step 1 of the withdrawal form gains an **optional** checklist of the order's products — tick the ones you're withdrawing from, or leave it empty to withdraw from the whole order (the default). The choice appears on the confirmation e-mail/PDF and in the admin Requests dashboard. It's informational: you still process the refund (full or partial) yourself. No change for anyone who withdraws from the whole order.

= 1.0.0-alpha.41 =
* **FluentCart handling is now configurable.** FluentCart is building its own withdrawal add-on, so a new **Settings → FluentCart** control lets you choose how this plugin behaves on FluentCart orders: **Auto** (recommended — show our button, but step aside automatically if FluentCart's own add-on is installed, so customers never see two buttons), **Always** (keep ours regardless), or **Off** (never handle FluentCart). Only our consumer-facing FluentCart surfaces are affected — the admin Requests dashboard and any in-flight confirmation keep working. No change for WooCommerce or EDD.

= 1.0.0-alpha.40 =
* **Admin UI styling restored + Swedish added.** The bundled WWU UI Kit is now shipped with the plugin (it was referenced but never packaged), so the Settings → Exemptions section (accordions, badges, notices) renders styled instead of plain. Added **Swedish (sv_SE)**: the statutory withdrawal-button label ("ångra avtalet här") and confirmation ("bekräfta frånträde") per the official EUR-Lex Art. 11a wording (Distansavtalslagen 2005:59), plus a complete UI translation (all 495 strings; the legal term "varaktigt medium" corrected) — pending a native Swedish review by Daniel before it's marked final.

= 1.0.0-alpha.39 =
* **Critical fix — the Settings page no longer fatals.** A merchant reported "Class WWU\WithdrawalButton\Admin\Settings not found", which crashed the whole settings screen. A missing `use` import made an unqualified `Settings::main()` resolve to the wrong namespace. Fixed, and a scan of all 91 source files confirmed there were no other cases. This release also carries a small mail-safety fix (the HTML mailer now always removes its `wp_mail_content_type` filter, so a third-party email error can't turn other plugins' plain-text emails into HTML) and a WooCommerce-surface + plugin-conflict audit (0 critical / 0 high). **Recommended for all installs.**

= 1.0.0-alpha.38 =
* **Subscriptions handled correctly (WooCommerce Subscriptions, FluentCart, EDD Recurring).** EU law gives one 14-day right of withdrawal per contract, at conclusion — a renewal does **not** restart it. The button now appears on the **initial order only** and is suppressed on renewal orders (single gate covering every surface). Two opt-in settings under **Settings → Subscriptions**: "also show on renewals" (off by default) and "auto-cancel the subscription on withdrawal" (off by default — the refund and any pro-rata always stay manual). The Requests dashboard flags subscription orders with a reminder. Renewal detection is guarded and fail-open (an undetermined state keeps the button visible). Needs a live test with a subscription plugin active.

= 1.0.0-alpha.37 =
* FluentCart e-mail merge-tag `{{wwu.recesso_url}}` — you can now drop the per-order withdrawal link into FluentCart's own transactional e-mails (the FluentCart team confirmed the value-resolver hook + its data context on 2026-06-15). It's registered in the FluentCart e-mail-editor picker and resolves safely (renders empty when there's no order in context). Needs a live FluentCart test. Note: FluentCart has told us they are shipping a native EU withdrawal feature soon, which may overlap this.

= 1.0.0-alpha.36 =
* Security hardening from a full-plugin security audit (0 critical, 0 high). Fixes: an SSRF guard for the merchant-configured RFC 3161 timestamp endpoint (blocks internal / cloud-metadata / IPv6-loopback / CGNAT targets); per-IP rate limiting on the withdrawal statement/confirm endpoints (REST + no-JS); length caps on the name/reason fields; tighter debug secret-masking; and a cron cleanup on uninstall. No change to the consumer-facing flow. Full report in docs/audits/.

= 1.0.0-alpha.35 =
* **EDD integration completed — the withdrawal button now appears on the EDD customer's own pages.** Easy Digital Downloads customers see the statutory withdrawal button on the **purchase receipt** and in **purchase history**, and the withdrawal link is added to the EDD **purchase-receipt e-mail** — reaching full parity with WooCommerce and FluentCart (previously EDD relied only on the standalone public page). Built on EDD 3.x hooks verified against the official EDD source. Fail-safe as everywhere: the button only shows on eligible orders and links to your withdrawal page pre-authenticated. Needs a live EDD test.

= 1.0.0-alpha.34 =
* FluentCart improvements, verified against a direct FluentCart-team reply: the consent checkbox now renders on `before_payment_methods` (covers the standard, modal **and** block checkout), FluentCart exemptions are now **category-aware** (via the `product-categories` taxonomy, matching WooCommerce and EDD), and withdrawal/refund notes appear in the FluentCart order **activity timeline** (`fluent_cart_add_log`). Also adds 3 shareable **live-test checklists** (WooCommerce block, FluentCart, EDD) under `docs/testing/`. No change to the consumer-facing button.

= 1.0.0-alpha.33 =
* Added **Easy Digital Downloads (EDD 3.0+)** as a third supported platform: the withdrawal button, evidence flow and exemption consent capture now work on EDD stores (with category-aware exemptions). Needs a live EDD test. Consent capture now spans WooCommerce (classic + block), FluentCart and EDD.

= 1.0.0-alpha.32 =
* Exemption consent capture now also works on the WooCommerce **block-based Checkout** (via the official Additional Checkout Fields API, WooCommerce 9.9+), reaching full parity with the classic checkout and FluentCart. Pure PHP, no build step. Also adds the design SPEC for a future Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) integration. Needs a live block-checkout test; fail-safe until verified.

= 1.0.0-alpha.31 =
* Exemptions settings redesigned: the reasons are grouped (conditional / unconditional / seal-based) with tooltips, examples, a "What do you sell?" guided helper, a preview of what the consumer sees (checkbox + confirmation e-mail), and a status panel — all using the WWU UI Kit. Completed the Italian (and FR/ES/DE) translations, including the exemption labels that previously showed in English. The withdrawal button itself is unchanged.

= 1.0.0-alpha.30 =
* Exemptions consent capture now works on **FluentCart** too (checkout acknowledgement + durable-medium confirmation), reaching parity with WooCommerce. Built on FluentCart hooks re-verified against the official docs. FluentCart exemptions match by product ID. The "Open order" admin link now uses FluentCart's own order URL. Needs a live FluentCart test; fail-safe until verified.

= 1.0.0-alpha.29 =
* Exemptions (Art. 59) — durable-medium confirmation + evidence, retention, GDPR. For the conditional exemptions the plugin now e-mails the consumer a durable-medium confirmation reproducing the agreed consent wording (constitutive for digital content, Art. 59(1)(o)) and logs the dispatch separately. Stored consents have a configurable retention (default 10 years) with a daily routine that anonymises the IP afterwards; the IP is configurable and never written to the immutable log. Adds a ready-to-paste GDPR privacy clause (legitimate interest) and a "Consent records" admin page with CSV export. Clearer wording everywhere: physical products never need consent; the button is hidden only after consent is captured (fail-safe).

= 1.0.0-alpha.28 =
* Exemptions (Art. 59) — checkout consent capture. For the two conditional exemptions (digital content with immediate access; service fully performed), WooCommerce checkout now shows a required acknowledgement tick-box and stores the agreed wording (with a SHA-256 hash, timestamp and IP) on the order as evidence — so the button is hidden for those items only once the consumer has lawfully consented. Statutory wording is filterable via `wwu_wb_consent_text`. Classic WooCommerce checkout; the block Checkout and FluentCart capture are tracked follow-ups.

= 1.0.0-alpha.27 =
* Exemptions (Art. 59) — per-reason product/category tagging. Mark products or categories as exempt by a specific statutory reason (custom-made, perishable, sealed hygiene, dated services, digital immediate, service performed, …), each with its legal reference and plain-language guidance. The right of withdrawal stays the default — including digital products — and conditional reasons keep the button until consent is captured.

= 1.0.0-alpha.19 =
* FluentCart customer portal: the "Right of withdrawal" account page, the sidebar entry, the per-order button and the dashboard banner now work. Every FluentCart hook was corrected to the official FluentCart developer contract (verified against dev.fluentcart.com), and the order chooser reads each order's data through the correct customer/address relations. Fixes the blank page and missing button seen in live testing.

= 1.0.0-alpha.18 =
* FluentCart: first cut of the customer-portal withdrawal surfaces, and a platform-agnostic order chooser that merges WooCommerce and FluentCart orders.

= 1.0.0-alpha.17 =
* Withdrawal flow (WooCommerce HPOS + FluentCart), statutory labels (IT/EN/DE/FR/ES), two-step + no-JS fallback, durable-medium acknowledgement (email + PDF + verifiable link), tamper-evident hash-chained log + OpenTimestamps, Annex I-B model form + legal clauses, shortcodes, admin dashboard + compliance page, Complianz/cache compatibility. Security audit: 0 findings.

= 1.0.0-alpha.1 =
* Foundation: bootstrap, schema (immutable log + timestamp tables), debug stack, REST diagnostics.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.2.0 =
Reminder: installing the button does not update your shop's legal texts. Your Terms & Conditions and pre-contractual information must describe the new withdrawal-button modality (Art. 6 CRD). The plugin now flags this and gives you the ready-to-paste clauses. No change to the flow.

= 1.0.0-alpha.43 =
Adds a consumer-facing "why exempt" note: on orders exempt under Art. 59, the plugin explains why the withdrawal button is absent (the exception + legal reference) instead of showing nothing. Editable, fail-safe, only on genuinely exempt orders; button visibility unchanged.

= 1.0.0-alpha.42 =
Adds an optional "which products" checklist to the withdrawal form (partial withdrawal), shown on the receipt and the Requests dashboard. Optional and fail-open — leaving it empty withdraws from the whole order as before. No breaking changes.

= 1.0.0-alpha.41 =
Adds a FluentCart handling mode (Auto/Always/Off) so this plugin steps aside automatically when FluentCart's own withdrawal add-on is installed. No breaking changes; WooCommerce and EDD are unaffected.

= 1.0.0-alpha.40 =
Restores the admin UI styling (the UI Kit is now bundled) and adds Swedish (statutory button label + complete UI translation, pending native review). No breaking changes.

= 1.0.0-alpha.39 =
Critical fix: the Settings page no longer crashes with a "Class … Settings not found" fatal. Update recommended for everyone. Also includes a mail-safety fix and a WooCommerce/conflict audit.

= 1.0.0-alpha.38 =
Subscriptions are handled correctly: the button shows on the initial order only and is hidden on renewals (one 14-day right per contract). Two opt-in toggles under Settings → Subscriptions. If you use WooCommerce/FluentCart/EDD subscriptions, test on staging.

= 1.0.0-alpha.37 =
FluentCart stores can now use the `{{wwu.recesso_url}}` merge-tag in FluentCart's own e-mails. No change for WooCommerce/EDD. FluentCart users: add the tag to a template and test on staging (FluentCart's own native withdrawal feature is also coming soon).

= 1.0.0-alpha.36 =
Security hardening from a full audit (0 critical/high): SSRF guard on the RFC 3161 endpoint, rate limits on the withdrawal endpoints, input length caps. Recommended for all installs; no behaviour change for consumers.

= 1.0.0-alpha.35 =
EDD stores now show the withdrawal button on the purchase receipt + purchase history, and add the withdrawal link to the EDD receipt e-mail (parity with WooCommerce/FluentCart). Set a public withdrawal page in Settings and re-test the EDD customer flow on staging.

= 1.0.0-alpha.34 =
FluentCart: consent now renders on the block/modal checkout too and is category-aware; order notes appear in the FluentCart timeline. No change for WooCommerce/EDD stores. FluentCart users: re-test the checkout consent on staging (checklist included).

= 1.0.0-alpha.33 =
Adds Easy Digital Downloads (EDD 3.0+) support. No change for WooCommerce/FluentCart stores. If you run EDD, test the checkout + button on staging.

= 1.0.0-alpha.32 =
Adds consent capture on the WooCommerce block Checkout (requires WooCommerce 9.9+ for the conditional field). No change to the classic checkout. Test on staging if you use the block checkout.

= 1.0.0-alpha.31 =
Settings/exemptions UI overhaul + completed Italian/FR/ES/DE translations (the exemption section was partly in English). No change to the withdrawal flow. Safe to update.

= 1.0.0-alpha.30 =
Adds FluentCart checkout consent capture for the conditional exemptions (parity with WooCommerce). Test on a staging FluentCart store before production; fail-safe (the button stays) until the field is verified on your setup.

= 1.0.0-alpha.29 =
Completes the digital/service exemptions: durable-medium confirmation e-mail, configurable consent retention with automatic IP anonymisation, a GDPR privacy clause and a Consent records page. Review the new clause + retention setting. Test on staging; not yet stable.

= 1.0.0-alpha.28 =
Adds lawful consent capture at checkout for digital-immediate and service-performed exemptions. If you exempt those product types, the button is now hidden only after the consumer ticks the required acknowledgement. Test on staging; not yet a stable release.

= 1.0.0-alpha.19 =
Recommended for FluentCart stores: fixes the customer-account withdrawal page (was blank) and the per-order button. Test on staging before production; not yet a stable release.

= 1.0.0-alpha.17 =
Feature-complete alpha. Test thoroughly on staging before production; not yet a stable release.
